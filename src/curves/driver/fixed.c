 * The math in this module is primarily based on minimax approximations, which
 * are polynomial functions that minimize the error of an approximation over a
 * specific range. Calculating approximations with them is reasonably
 * efficient, but determining their coefficients is nontrivial; the process
 * runs Chubuchev polynomials through a truncation-aware Remez exchange
 * algorithm. To manage this, they were generated by a open source, academic
 * tool called Sollya. The scripts used to generate the coefficients are listed
 * next to the coefficients themselves.
